**********Def:********** Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $\mathbb F$ not of characteristic $2$. A function $K: V \to\mathbb F$ is called a *****************_quadratic form on $V$_ if there exists a symmetric bilinear form $H\in \mathcal B(V)$ such that

$$ K(x)= H(x,x) $$

********Th:******** Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $\mathbb F$ not of characteristic $2$, and let $H$ be a symmetric bilinear from on $V$. If $K(x) = H(x,x)$ is the quadratic form associated with $H$, then for all $x, y \in V$,

$$ H(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}[K(x+y) -K(x)-K(y) ] $$

********Th:******** Let $V$ be a finite dimensional real inner product space, and let $H$ be a symmetric bilinear form on $V$. Then there exists an orthonormal basis $\beta$ for $V$ such that $\psi_\beta(H)$ is a diagonal matrix.

**********Cor:********** Let $K$ be a quadratic form on a finite dimensional real inner product space $V$. There exists an orthonormal basis $\beta = \{v_i\}_{i = 1}^n$ for $V$ and scalars $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots \lambda_n$ such that $x \in V$ and

$$ x = \sum_{k =1}^n s_k v_k $$

Then

$$ K(x) = \sum_{k =1}^n\lambda_k s_k ^2 $$

### ********Principal Axes Theorem********

Let $A \in \mathcal M_n(\Bbb R)$ be a symmetric matrix, then there exists an orthogonal matrix $P$ such that $y = P^\top x$ and changes the quadratic form $x^\top Ax$ into the quadratic form $y^\top Dy$, where $D$ is diagonal, that has non cross-terms.

**Def:** Let $K$ be a quadratic form on $\Bbb R^n$

- $K$ is **positive definite** if $K(x)>0$ for all $x \in \Bbb R^n$, and $K$ is **positive semidefinite** if $K(x) \ge 0$ for all $x \in \Bbb R^n$.
- $K$ is **negative definite** if $K(x)<0$ for all $x \in \Bbb R^n$, and $K$ is **negative semidefinite** if $K(x) \le 0$ for all $x \in \Bbb R^n$.
- $K$ is **indefinite** if $K(x)$ is positive for some $x \in \Bbb R$ and negative for others.

********Th:******** Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ symmetric matrix, and suppose that ${K(x) = x^\top Ax}$. Then
- $K$ is positive definite exactly when $A$ has only positive eigenvalues
- $K$ is negative definite exactly when $A$ has only negative eigenvalues
- $K$ is indefinite exactly when $A$ has positive and negative eigenvalues

********Th:******** Let $K$ be a quadratic form on $\Bbb R^n$

$$ K(x) = \sum_{k =1}^n a_k x^2_k $$

that has no cross-product terms. Let $a_i$ and $a_j$ be the maximum and minimum respectively of the coefficients $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. Then subject to the constraint $\|x\|=1$,
- The maximum value of $K(x)$ is $a_i$, attained at $x = e_i$
- The minimum value of $K(x)$ is $a_j$, attained at $x = e_j$

**Cor:** Let $K(x) =x^\top Ax$ where $A$ is a symmetric $n\times n$ matrix. Suppose that $A$ has eigenvalues $\lambda_1 \le \lambda_2\le \cdots \le \lambda_n$, and let ${u_1, \dots, u_n}$ be the associated eigenvectors. The subject to the constraint $\|x\| = 1$, we have
- The maximum value of $K(x)$ is $\lambda_n$, attained at $x = u_n$
- The minimum value of $K(x)$ is $\lambda_1$, attained at $x = u_1$

**Cor:** Let $K(x) =x^\top Ax$ where $A$ is a symmetric $n\times n$ matrix. Suppose that $A$ has eigenvalues $\lambda_1 \le \lambda_2\le \cdots \le \lambda_n$, and let ${u_1, \dots, u_n}$ be the associated eigenvectors. The subject to the constraint $\|x\| = 1$ and $x \cdot u_n =0$, we have
- The maximum value of $K(x)$ is $\lambda_{n-1}$, attained at $x = u_{n-1}$
- The minimum value of $K(x)$ is $\lambda_1$, attained at $x = u_1$

**Th:** Let $A$ be a positive definite matrix, then $$p(x) = x^\top A x-2x^\top f + c$$reaches its minimum at $x_0 = A^{-1}f$ and additionally its minimum value is $$p(x_0) = c - x_0^\top A x_0$$
