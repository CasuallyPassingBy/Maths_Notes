There are various methods for solving equations of the form $f(x) = 0$:
Non Iterative Methods:
- [[Bisection Method]]
Iterative Methods:
- [[Fixed Point Iteration]]
- [[Newton's Method]]
- [[Horner and Müller Methods]]
- [[Secant Method]]

There a couple of aspects for iterative methods:
- [[Error Analysis of Iterative Methods]]
- [[Accelerating Convergence for Iterative Methods]]
