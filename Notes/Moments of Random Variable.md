## Moments

The moments of a random variable $X$ or of its distribution is the collection of numbers

$$ E[X], E[X^2], E[X^3], \dots $$

corresponding to the first moment, second moment, etc. when they exist

There are multiple types of moments,

| Formula | Type |
| ---- | ---- |
| $E[(X-\mu)^n]$ | $n$th central moment |
| $E[\|X\|^n]$ | $n$th absolute moment |
| $E[\|X-\mu\|^n]$ | $n$th absolute central moment |
| $E[(X-c)^n]$ | $n$th generalized moment (constant $c$) |
| $E[X^{\underline n}]$ | $n$th factorial moment  |
