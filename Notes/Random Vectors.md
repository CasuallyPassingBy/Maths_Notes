A random vector is a function $X: \Omega \to \Bbb R^n$ such that  for any set $B \in {\scr B}(\Bbb R^n)$, it follows that $X^{-1}[B] \in {\scr F}$

The function $(X_1, \dots, X_n): \Omega \to \Bbb R^n$ be a random vector, iff, each coordinate is a random variable

A random vector of dimension $2$, is a vector of the form $(X, Y)$ where each coordinate is a random variable. Analogously we define multidimensional random vectors $(X_1, \dots, X_n)$. We say that a random vector is discrete or continuous when all the random variables the form it are discrete or continuous, respectively. 

We will mainly use two dimensional random vectors but it can be the $n$-dimensional random vectors are possible.
