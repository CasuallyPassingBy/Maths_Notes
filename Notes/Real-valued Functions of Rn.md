**Def:** Let $f:S\subseteq \Bbb R^n \to \Bbb R$, them $f$ is called an _scalar field on $S$._

**Def:** Let $f:S\subseteq \Bbb R^n \to \Bbb R$, the set of all points in $S$ at which the function takes the value $c\in \Bbb R$ will be called a *******level set.******* More formally, the level set corresponding to $c$ is:

$$ f^{-1}(c) =\{\mathbf{x} \in S\mid f(\mathbf{x}) = c\} $$

**Def:** Let $f:S\subseteq \Bbb R^n \to \Bbb R$, the *****_graph of $f$_ is the subset of $\Bbb R^{n+1}$ given by:

$$ \{(x_1, \dots,x_n, x_{n+1}) \in \Bbb R^{n+1} \mid x_{n+1} = f(x_1, \dots, x_n) \} $$

Equivalent the graph is ${\{(\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{x}) \in \Bbb R^{n+1} \mid \mathbf{x}\in S\}}$. The expression $x_{n+1} = f(\mathbf{x})$ is called the ********equation******** of the graph.
