**Def:** Let $T(\underline X)$ be a test statistic that for large values of $T$ give evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis. For each possible value of $\underline X$, $$\underline x= (x_1, \dots, x_n)\in \frak X$$we define the $p$-value as $$p(\underline x) = \max_{\theta \in \Theta_0}P(T\underline (X)) \ge t(\underline x))$$where $t(\underline x)$ is the value of the statistic $T(\underline X)$ on $\underline x$. 
The inequality of the probability would be inverted if for smaller values of $T$ give evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis. 

A $p$-value, $p(\underline x)$, satisfies that $0\le p(\underline x) \le 1$ for each value of the sample $\underline x$. Small values of $p(\underline x)$ give evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ being true.
