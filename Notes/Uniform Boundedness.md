Let $Y$ be a metric space, $\mathcal F \subseteq F(X, Y) = Y^X$. 

We say that $\mathcal F$ is uniformly bounded on $A\subseteq X$, if there's an element $a \in Y$ and $M>0$ such that for all $f\in \mathcal F$ and every $x\in X$, $d(f(x), a) \le M$ 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be metric space, we say that $\mathcal F$ is locally bounded if for every $x\in X$, there's $r >0$ with $B_r(z) \subseteq X$ such that $\mathcal F$ is uniformly bounded on $B_r(z)$

Let $\mathcal F \subseteq \mathcal C(X, Y)$. Then $\cal F$ is locally bounded on $X$ iff for every $K \subseteq U$ compact is uniformly bounded on $K$

If $f_n \rightrightarrows f$ on $A$, then $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly bounded on $A$.
