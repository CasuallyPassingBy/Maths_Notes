**********Def:********** Let $z_0 \in \Bbb C$. We say that $z_0$ is an *********_isolated singularity of the function $f$_, if there’s $r>0$ such that $f$ is analytic in $B_r(z_0)\setminus\{z_0\}$

There are three types of isolated singularities:
- [[Removable Singularities]]
- [[Poles of Analytic Functions|Poles of Analytic Functions]]
- [[Essential Singularities]]

**********Def:********** Let $f: \Omega \to \Bbb C$. We say that $z = \infty$ is isolated singularity of $f$, if $z= 0$ is a isolated singularity of the function $g(z) = f(1/z)$. In this case we say that $z = \infty$ is a removable singularty, a pole of order $k$, or an essential singularity of $f$ if $z=0$ is a removable singularty, a pole of order $k$, or an essential singularity of $g$ ^1f45b1
