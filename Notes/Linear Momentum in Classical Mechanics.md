Using the second law we get that, and considering external forces for those objects
$$
{\mathbf{\dot p}}_1 = \mathbf{F}_1 = \mathbf{F}_{12} + \mathbf{F}_1^\text{ext}
$$
$$
\mathbf{\dot p}_2 = \mathbf{F}_2 = \mathbf{F}_{21} + \mathbf{F}_2^\text{ext}
$$
Then, just by linearity of the derivative we get
$$
\bf P = p_1 + p_2 \implies \dot P = \dot p_1 + \dot p_2
$$
Getting that
$$
\bf \dot P = F ^\text{ext} = F_1^\text{ext} + F_2^\text{ext}
$$
Then we get that there's no external force, then
$$
\mathbf F^\text{ext} = 0 \implies \mathbf P = \text{const}
$$
### Multiparticle systems
If we have $N$ particles and we have that the index we are going to use is $\alpha$, then each particle has $\bf p_\alpha$ momentum, the force on the particle generated by the other $(N-1)$ particles can be quite complicated, simplifying a bit, then we denote the force on $\alpha$ by the particle $\beta$ as $\bf F_{\alpha \beta}$. Then the force on the particle $\alpha$, is 
$$
	\mathbf{F}_\alpha = \sum_{\beta \ne \alpha} \mathbf{F}_{\alpha\beta} + \mathbf{F}_\alpha ^\text{ext}
$$
By using the second law we get that
$$
\mathbf{\dot p}_\alpha =  \sum_{\beta \ne \alpha} \mathbf{F}_{\alpha\beta} + \mathbf{F}_\alpha ^\text{ext}
$$
The momentum of the system is
$$
\mathbf{P} = \sum_{\alpha } \mathbf{p}_\alpha \implies \mathbf{\dot P} = \sum_{\alpha } \mathbf{\dot p}_\alpha
$$
Then plugging into the equations we get
$$
\mathbf{\dot P} = \sum_{\alpha} \sum_{\beta \ne \alpha} \mathbf{F}_{\alpha\beta} + \sum_{\alpha }\mathbf{F}_\alpha ^\text{ext}
$$
We can since everything on the first sum cancels out, then we see that
$$
\mathbf{\dot P} = \sum_{\alpha} \mathbf{F}_\alpha^\text{ext} = \mathbf{F}^\text{ext}
$$
#### Principle of Conservation of Momentum
If the net external force $\bf{F}^\text{ext}$ of an $N$-particle system is zero, the system $\bf P$ is constant. 

We examine a system of $N$ particles labelled $\alpha =1, \dots , N$. We found that as long as all the internal forces obey Newton’s third law, the rate of change of the system’s total linear momentum ${\bf P} = \sum {\bf p}_\alpha$ is determined by the external forces of the system

$$ \dot{\bf P} = {\bf F}^\text{ext} $$

where ${\bf F}^\text{ext}$ denotes the total external force of the system.

In the net external force ${\bf F}^\text{ext}$ on an $N$-particle system is zero, the system’s total mechanical momentum ${\bf P} = \sum m_\alpha {\bf v}_\alpha$ is constant.

### Inelastic Collisions
We can model perfectly inelastic collisions of two particles, with negligible external forces. We have that ${\bf P}_\text{in}$ (the momentum before the collision)

$$ {\bf P}_\text{in} = m_1 {\bf v_1} + m_2{\bf v_2} $$

and ${\bf P}_\text{fin}$ (the momentum after the collision)

$$ {\bf P}_\text{fin} = (m_1 + m_2)\bf v $$

By conservation of momentum, we have that ${\bf P}_\text{in} = {\bf P}_\text{fin}$, meaning we can calculate $\bf v$

$$ {\bf v} = \frac{m_1{\bf v}_1+ m_2{\bf v}_2}{m_1 + m_2} $$
an important case of the equation is when $\mathbf v_2 = 0$, then
$$
\mathbf v = \frac{m_1}{m_1+m_2} \mathbf v_1
$$
