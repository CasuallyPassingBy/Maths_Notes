***Def:*** A set $K \subseteq \Bbb{R}$ is ********sequentially compact******** if for every sequence in $K$ has a subsequence that converges to a limit that is also in $K$.

***Def:******* A set $A \subseteq \Bbb{R}$ is ********bounded******** if there’s $M>0$ such that $|a| \le M$ for all $a \in A$

### Bolzano-Weiestrass Theorem
Let $A\subseteq \Bbb{R}$ be a infinite bounded set, then has at least a limit point, i.e. $A' \ne \varnothing$. This is a reformulation of the [[Properties of Limits of Sequences in R#Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem|Bolzano-Weiestrass theorem for sequences]].

**Th (Characterization of Sequential Compactness in $\Bbb{R}$):** A set $K \subseteq \Bbb{R}$ is sequentially compact iff it is closed and bounded.

## Open Covers

********Def:********* Let $A \subseteq \Bbb{R}$. An **************open cover************** for $A$ is a (possibly infinite) collection of open sets ${\{U_\lambda \mid \lambda \in \Lambda\}}$ whose union contains the set $A$; that is $A \subseteq \bigcup_{\lambda\in \Lambda} U_\lambda$. Given an open cover for $A$, a ****************finite subcover**************** is a finite subcollection of open sets from the original open cover whose union still manages to completely contain $A$.

********Def:******** A set $K \subseteq \Bbb{R}$ is called ********compact******** if for every open cover there’s a finite subcover

### Heine-Borel Theorem

Let $K \subseteq \Bbb{R}$. All of the following statements are equivalent:

- $K$ is sequentially compact
- $K$ is compact
- $K$ is closed and bounded

### Nested Compact Set Property

Let $(K_n)_{n \in \Bbb{N}}$ be a nested sequence of nonempty compact sets, then

$$ \bigcap_{n \in \Bbb{N}} K_n \ne \varnothing $$
This is equivalent to the [[Complete Metric Spaces|completeness of R]]

**Def**: A system of sets $S$ has the *finite intersection property* if every nonempty finite subsystem of $S$ has nonempty intersection.

Any system of compact intervals in $\Bbb R$ with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection

Any system of compact sets in $\Bbb R$ with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection
