# Getting Started
To get started with the notes, you can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CasuallyPassingBy/My_Notes.git
```

Feel free to navigate through the directories and explore the notes on various topics. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
Since almost everything is markdown and they are linking to each other I reccomend using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and open a vault on the directory called Notes. This is the way I personally use this repository.
